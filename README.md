# Bitcoin Fraud Detection

Cryptocurrencies have long suffered from a tainted reputation due to their involvement in frauds and other illicit activities, where users take advantage of the pseudo-anonymity of these assets to move around suspicious funds. As the popularity of cryptos, such as Bitcoin, grew so did the use of these assets as investments, with financial institutions seeking to find ways to include services related to cryptos into their product offerings. 

This repository shows a example of a research over the most suitable methods to improve the classification of fraudulent and non-fraudulent Bitcoin addresses by extracting covariates associated with Bitcoin transactions via graph embedding techniques. To meet this objective, the project was split into three main parts: (i) graph sampling; (ii) feature creation by extracting embeddings; and the (iii) training of multiple classifier algorithms and assessing expected results.
